# QNX Vehicle Control System

This repository contains our project for COMP4900 RTOS class.

We are implementing a QNX-based vehicle control system that uses RTOS principles to ensure that critical components stay healthy and active under varying levels of stress on the system.

## Components

The project consists of three main components:

1. **Vehicle Simulation** - Simulates vehicle behavior and dynamics
2. **QNX Control System** - Real-time operating system handling critical control tasks
3. **User Controls and Dashboard** - Interface for monitoring and controlling the system
